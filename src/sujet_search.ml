  (* The idea is to stream the product of two series by 'diagonals', as if
   * the pairs were represented in a matrix as below:
   *
   * .     A     B     C     D
   * X (X,A) (X,B) (X,C) (X,D)
   * Y (Y,A) (Y,B) (Y,C) (Y,D)
   * Z (Z,A) (Z,B) (Z,C) (Z,D)
   *
   * This gives us something like that:
   *
   *  (X,A) 
   *  (X,B) (Y,A)
   *  (X,C) (Y,B) (Z,A)
   *  (X,D) (Y,C) (Z,B)
   *  (Y,D) (Z,C)
   *  (Z,D)
   *
   * The algorithm in pseudo-code:
   *
   * stack = []
   * for x_i in S1:
   *   stack << x_i
   *   stack2 = stack
   *   for y_j in S2 AND while stack2 not empty:
   *     stream (x_i, y_j)
   *     pop stack2
   *
   * The issue is that we re-compute S2's solutions for each S1's one.
   *
   * Example:
   *
   * with S1 = [1,2,3,4]
   *      S2 = [A,B]
   *
   * stack = [1]
   * (1,A)
   * stack = [1,2]
   * (2,A)
   * (1,B)
   * stack = [1,2,3]
   * (3,A)
   * (2,B)
   * stack = [1,2,3,4]
   * (4,A)
   * (3,B)
   *       --> problem here, (4,B) is missing (FIXME)
   *           this is an issue only for finite streams
