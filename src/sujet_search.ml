  (* The .prod function took a lot of time to be correctly implemented, and
   * various strategies have been tested. The one which is implemented below
   * works with a 'diagonal': We progress through the matrice with a diagonal
   * North-East -> South-West. To be clear, here is the thought model:
   * 
   *  the carthesian product is a (possibly infinite) matrice where columns are
   *  S1's values (S1 is the first stream, S2 is the second one), and lines are
   *  S2's. For example, prod {1, 2} {"a", "b"} gives:
   *
   *  |  -S1->
   * S2  1a 2a
   *  |  1b 2b
   *  V
   *
   * We keep track of S1's elements in a stack and for each element, we add it
   * on the stack, then enter a subroutine with a copy of this stack which
   * loops on it and at each time pick S2's next element and the top of the
   * stack, create the pair and continues until S2 and/or the stack are empty.
   * Then the main routine continues to S1's next element.
   *
   * The problem of this implementation is that on products where S1 is finite,
   * pairs below the diagonale are never computed, in our previous example '2b'
   * is not in the product. I spent a few hours trying to fix this to work with
   * all kind of products, and tested other implementations, for example by
   * walking the matrice using reversed "L" (in our example, this would give us
   * 1a, then 2a, 2b, 1b), but it was not elegant and didn't work properly. I
   * then went back on my original implementation and added 'prod_finite_s1'
   * which is called when we reach S1's end. It takes the stack of its
   * elements, and it add the missing elements to the product. It also works if
   * S1 is finite but not S2.
